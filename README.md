# .Net Training / Unit Test Module
 The goal of this module is to provide an overview of different types of tests with a focus on unit tests. You will learn TDD (test-driven development) and the difference between mocks and stubs. For the practical task you will implement Katas - code challenges focused on improving unit testing skill.

## Task
Do any 3 TDD Katas from list.zip (inside “Unit Testing.zip”).
 
Discuss with mentor your selection of tasks

Read KatasReadme.md for additional information

Commit history must reflect proper TDD flow for solution. Git commits should follow 7 rules of good commit message.
